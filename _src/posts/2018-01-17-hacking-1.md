In this post we will discover the very basic fundamentals of "hacking" often seen either as some ridiciulous hollywood style thing, or a mysterious dark art.  The following picture is not a very close approximation to the real thing.

To achieve this we will study one of the oldest and most widespread exploits of them all - the buffer overlow.  This type of exploit is quite hard to pull off on modern operating systems and programs compiled with modern compilers, to achieve it on windows 10 we will have to switch off a bunch of security features that would otherwise massively complicate and extend the length of the post. 

First, let's write a a silly little C program we can hack.

```c
int main()
{
  char input[100];
  ZeroMemory(&input,100);
  fscanf(stdin, "%s", input);
  if(input == "the magic string")
    {
      printf("you entered the magic string!");
    }
  else
    {
      printf("that is not the magic string.");
    }
  return 0;
}
```

There is nothing to stop the input being longer than the buffer of 100 characters.  Ultimately, the goal will be to get the program to execute some code we inject into it.  First things first, though, we compile this program using Microsoft's C++ compiler cl.exe with the following flags:

```
cl exploit.c -GS- /link /DYNAMICBASE:NO /NXCOMPAT:NO
```

The gs- flag stops the compiler from inserting what are known as "XOR canaries" (love the name!) a security mechanism to detect if something has corrupted the stack.  DYNAMICBASE:NO  stops the program from being subject to "Address Space Layout Randomization" (ASLR) which means the stack and libraries will always be loaded a the same virtual addresses, significantly simplifing our task.  The final flag switches off DEP compatability, a hardware and software security mechanism to stop code being executed in memory pages where it shouldn't (like the stack, for example). 

With this we are ready to begin!

## Inspecting the program

First, let's go over how the x86 processor family support calling functions.  Depending on the calling convention, the function arguments are passed on the stack and or in some registers.  When the CALL instruction is executed, the processor pushes the the instruction pointer onto the stack, and then sets the instruction pointer to the address of the function.   Wehn RET is executed, the processor pops the return address off the stack and sets the instruciton pointer to it.   This is the attack vector - if you can change that return address, you can control where the processor jumps to as it leaves the function.

Let's look at our program to see this in action

The first three lines are what is known as the function prologue.  The first two lines establish a new stack frame by first preserving the address of the previous stack frame, held in EBP, then replacing it with whatever the stack pointer is currently poiting at (ESP).  The EBP (base pointer) register is typically used for this purpose, though it doesn't have to.  The reasoning behind this ceremony is that you now have a relative address (EBP) with which to access function arguments and local variables.

The third line subtracts 0x64 (100) from the stack pointer (the stack grows downwards in memory).  This is the space reserved for the local character array we asked for.  The start of the character array sits at EBP - 64.

If we let the program run a bit until after the ZeroMemory call has been executed, the stack looks like this.

Right at the top is the start of our character array.  At the bottom, you can see the return address followed by the previous stack frame address (19FF80).

Now, as an experiment, let's enter some text input via the fscanf and have a look at the stack.  fscanf only reads up to the first whitespace character it finds (this will be a problem later!).

Here you can see the character data.  Looking at it in the memory dump shows the text

So, the question is - what happens if we input enough text to overflow right over the top of the return address or beyond?  Typically, the program will probably crash with an access vilolation when it tries to return to some rubbish address - unless, of course, we put a vlaid address of our choosing in there instead.

## Taking control

Let's try it.  In this simple example where we know the addresses don't change, we can see the "you entered the magic string!" section of the code starts at 0x.  We can construct an input that is 100 bytes of padding, follwed by another 4 bytes of padding (this is the previous stack frame value) and finally the address 0x in little endian fashion.  The string in ascii looks like this
